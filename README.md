In this repository, I have added two of jupyter notebooks that I have taken part of during my exchange semester at NovaIMS. 

The datamining_project.ipynb notebook was made as a group assignment in the practical part of Data Mining course. The code starts with data exploration and preprocessing. After this part, we had to make a decision about what
to do with a specific missing values in one of columns in the dataset. After managing the outliers and visualizing the correlations, we have proceeded to clustering of the data, exploring various clustering methods and
deciding on which has given us the best cluster.

The pandas_showcase.ipynb was made as an assignment in pairs in the practical part of Programming for Data Science course. The code showcases the ability to explore and process the data in pandas, as well as write some
funcitons that would give us the requested information.
